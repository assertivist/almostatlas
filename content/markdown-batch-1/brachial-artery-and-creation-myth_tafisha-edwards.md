# How to Drain the Brachial Artery
## Tafisha Edwards

<p>believe a man 27 years older than you loves you.
suck him off and moan with the last of the air
in your throat. do not breathe in after you swallow.
</p>

<p>counterfeit 96.4 weeks of orgasms. wait for a kiss.
read your palms in the bathroom after you moan
with the last of the air in your throat. do not
</p>

<p>breathe in. sever your love line. hemorrhage, but
do it quietly because you need to go back
and mass produce another orgasm in the sweatshop
</p>

<p>that is your bed. the blood you fracked from your body
through the pipeline of your love line now sloshes
in the open cavity of your bathroom sink.
</p>

<p>the man that is 27 years older than you is colorblind
so he calls the blood water and spits in it but remember—
he has a heightened sense of smell and knows this is not
</p>

<p>water. remember. do not breathe in. take your bloodless
body back to bed and forget
</p>

<p class='middle'>you have a voice.</p>

<p>fail to understand that orgasm and sound are simply
vibrations passing through narrow and damp spaces
of the body. cause no drama. tell no one. take
</p>

<p>your bloodless body to the bed and moan in a 2/5
time signature. call this music. make an album. win
a Grammy. when he pulls your hair at the root call
</p>

<p>the not blood             not water slicking  your thighs
a mercy.
</p>

# Creation Myth #18
## Tafisha Edwards

How I was made:                    “I see you. You are a part of me.”

<p class="left"><em>The mark of greatness</em></p>

I don’t remember what I was before you what I was isn’t memorable

<p>is when
you were worried I would go crazy.
     I did.  but I am not lot’s wife—I look and look
               at the ruins (me) and do not die.
</p>

<p class="middle"><em>everything before you</em></p>

I don’t remember how I was before you how I was isn’t memorable

<p class='right'><em>is obsolete</em></p>

<p class="middle">           what to call this: murder?
<span class="middle">                    maturity?</span>
</p>

I don’t remember where I was before you where I was isn’t memorable

<em>and everything after</em>

<p class="middle">to survive I unremember: how to know, your unlistening
<span class="middle">     deadweight, a short film starring your ex</span>
<span class="middle">& her nimbus of hair,</span>
</p>

<p class="right"><em>                    you</em></p>

<p class='left'>  I keep: your hand under my dress in a movie theater,
<span class="left">                your head on my shoulder in a movie theater, 28 snores</span>
<span class="left">                of perfume on my neck.</span>
</p>

I don’t remember why I was before you why I was isn’t memorable

<p class="middle"><em>bears your mark.</em></p>

<p class="right">all things question their makers—
<span class="right">if you did not love me, then why?</span>
</p>
