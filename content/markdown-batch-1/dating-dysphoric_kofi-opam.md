Over the phone today, my therapist asks me, the way she always asks me, how I’m feeling. I tell her I’m feeling confused; I’ve been living in Seattle for the past three weeks and somehow, life here is feeling more and more translucent, foggy. I don’t tell her I’m standing on a roof of some condo in Capitol Hill, watching cottony clouds roll westward towards the Space Needle.
